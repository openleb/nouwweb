Lebanese Parliament API (nouwweb)
===================================

About
=====
This is an API to query information about Lebanese members of parliament. The current data reflects the 2009 Parliament.
The project is a joint effort by SMEX and Lamba Labs.

* Repository:    https://github.com/openleb/nouwweb
* Issues:        https://github.com/openleb/nouwweb/issues
* Documentation: http://nouwweb.rtfd.org/

Usage
=====

The API is very simple to use and follows REST parameter conventions. A request to the API will return a JSON list of results according to the URL param string. 

Users can either get a list of values such as the list of districts at the endpoint ``/districts``, or search for a subset of members of parliament using the endpoint ``/search``. 

For example, here's the list of legislators that have a mobile phone in the district *Beirut I*

.. code-block:: none

	curl 'http://api.openleb.io/search?mobile=true&district=Beirut%20I&prettyprint=true'
